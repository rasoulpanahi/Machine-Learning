These metrics provide insights into how well a model is performing in terms of correctly predicting classes from the available data. Here's why they are crucial and a brief overview of some of the most famous metrics:\n",

    "- **Use**: Important when identifying all positive instances is crucial, such as in disease detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. F1-Score**\n",
