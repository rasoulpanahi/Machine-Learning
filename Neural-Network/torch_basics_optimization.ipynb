    "\n",
    "<p>Initialization of neural network parameters is a crucial step in the optimization process. Proper initialization can significantly impact the convergence speed and performance of the network. Below are some commonly used initialization techniques:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: #4b0082;\">1. Zero Initialization</h3>\n",
    "<p>In zero initialization, all weights are set to zero. However, this technique is generally not used because it causes all neurons to learn the same features during training, leading to poor performance.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: #4b0082;\">2. Random Initialization</h3>\n",
    "<p>Weights are initialized randomly, often from a Gaussian or uniform distribution. This breaks the symmetry and allows different neurons to learn different features.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: #4b0082;\">3. Xavier Initialization (Glorot Initialization)</h3>\n",
    "<p>Xavier initialization aims to maintain the variance of activations and gradients throughout the layers. Weights are initialized from a distribution with zero mean and a specific variance:</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "$$ \\text{Var}(W) = \\frac{2}{n_{\\text{in}} + n_{\\text{out}}} $$\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "<p>where \\( n_{\\text{in}} \\) is the number of input units in the layer, and \\( n_{\\text{out}} \\) is the number of output units.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: #4b0082;\">4. He Initialization</h3>\n",
    "<p>He initialization, also known as Kaiming initialization, is specifically designed for layers with ReLU activation functions. It aims to keep the variance of activations similar to that of the inputs. Weights are initialized as:</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "$$ \\text{Var}(W) = \\frac{2}{n_{\\text{in}}} $$\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "<p>where \\( n_{\\text{in}} \\) is the number of input units in the layer.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: #4b0082;\">5. LeCun Initialization</h3>\n",
    "<p>LeCun initialization is similar to He initialization but is designed for layers with sigmoid or tanh activation functions. The variance of weights is set as:</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "$$ \\text{Var}(W) = \\frac{1}{n_{\\text{in}}} $$\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: #4b0082;\">Summary</h3>\n",
    "<p>Choosing the right initialization technique is vital for the effective training of neural networks. Techniques like Xavier and He initialization help maintain the variance of activations and gradients, promoting faster convergence and better performance. Understanding the characteristics of your network and the activation functions used can guide you in selecting the most appropriate initialization method.</p>\n",
